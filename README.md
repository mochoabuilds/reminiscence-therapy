* We are outliving the evolutionary lifespan of our brains. Our computer vision application helps humans with dementia remember how to use objects that once baffled them. It does this by sensing their hesitation, linking it to relevant human action-object interactions and automatically playing videos of family/friends describing how to use the object in question.  My goal is to jog memories of once forgotten objects thru familiar sights and sounds.
* There is a huge shortage of trained professionals who feel comfortable recognizing dementia symptoms, so developing and validating computer vision technologies for such applications would greatly help.
