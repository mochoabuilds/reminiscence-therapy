* We are outliving the evolutionary lifespan of our brains. Our computer vision application helps humans with dementia remember how to use objects that once baffled them. It does this by sensing their hesitation, linking it to relevant human action classes and automatically playing videos of family/friends describing how to use the object in question.  My goal is to jog memories of once forgotten objects thru familiar sights and sounds. This computer vision application could prove helpful as humanity ages and the numbers of people with dementia swells.
