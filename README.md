* Humans with dementia are helped to remember how to use once baffling objects with computer vision that senses their hestiation along with relevant human actions.  Video clips from family members/friends then automatically play describing how to use the object.  The goal is to jog memories of once forgotten objects thru familiar sights and sounds. This computer vision application could prove helpful as humanity ages and the numbers of people with dementia swells.
