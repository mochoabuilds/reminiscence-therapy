* We are outliving the evolutionary lifespan of our brains. From forgetting how to do familiar tasks, to a flattening of personality the diseases of dementia impairs day-to-day life.  Currently 1 in 10 adults in the U.S. over 65 have age related dementia, an umbrella term for cognitive decline.  Generally speaking, dementia has four stages -- very mild, mild, moderate and severe.  Our computer vision applications uses oodles of computing power to extract AI models from real-time video streams and turn them into services. Services that help adults with mild and very mild stage dementia remember familar tasks.  There is a huge shortage of trained professionals who feel comfortable recognizing dementia symptoms, so developing and validating computer vision technologies for such services would greatly help.
