* Humans are outliving the evolutionary lifespand of their brains.  Currently, 1 in 10 adults in the U.S. over 65 have age related dementia, an umbrella term for cognitive decline. Generally speaking, dementia has four stages -- very mild, mild, moderate and severe.   Mild cases vary from forgetting how to do familiar tasks to a "flattening" of personality, and impair day-to-day life. Our technology absorbs human behaviors related to very mild and mild dementia and responds with warm audio/visual reminders from friends and family.
* I believe there is a huge shortage of trained professionals who feel comfortable recognizing dementia, so developing and validating technology for such services would greatly help.
