* Humans with dementia are helped to remember how to use once baffling objects with triggered video clips of family members/friends describing their use.  The goal is to jog memories of objects thru familiar sights and sounds explaining how to use them.  It is done via automatic recognition of their hesitation + relevant human action / object classes. This computer vision application could prove helpful as humanity ages and the numbers of people with dementia swells.
